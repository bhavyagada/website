  <h2>What to blog about?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm unsure what to write. Other bloggers seem to have it all figured out, with their polished websites and engaging content. I often wonder when I'll reach that level, questioning if I have anything unique or useful to offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's easy to forget the persistence it takes to be prolific and refine one's skills. It takes effort!
  </p>
  <p>
    My main challenge is committing to the <strong>consistent</strong> effort required. I've realized that my hesitation comes from fear of the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used to think my writing needed to be novel and insightful to be worthwhile. Now I understand that I'm writing for myself, not to meet arbitrary standards. This self-imposed pressure is a mental trap that does nothing but hold me back.
  </p>  
  <p>
    I'm letting go of perfectionism and allowing myself to write freely. This approach will help me learn, improve, and enjoy the journey. I won't doubt myself until I've written at least 100 blogs. The path won't be easy, but I can at least make it fun and rewarding.
